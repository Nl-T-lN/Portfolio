    aboutme: "Hello, I'm Nitin. My journey into cybersecurity began with a deep curiosity for understanding how systems workâ€”and more importantly, how they can be broken. I am driven by the constant challenge of an ever-evolving digital landscape and thrive on the process of identifying, exploiting, and mitigating complex security vulnerabilities. My focus is on practical, hands-on application. Whether I'm dissecting a vulnerable machine, developing a custom script to automate reconnaissance, or analyzing malware in my homelab, I am committed to a process of continuous learning and skill development. I believe the most effective defense is built upon a profound understanding of the offense, and I dedicate my efforts to mastering that adversarial perspective.",
